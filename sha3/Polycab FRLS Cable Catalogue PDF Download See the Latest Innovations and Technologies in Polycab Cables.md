## Benefits of FRLS Cables
 
FRLS cables have many advantages over conventional PVC cables, especially in terms of fire safety and environmental protection. Some of the benefits of FRLS cables are:

- FRLS cables are flame retardant and can stop the propagation of fires due to cables. These cables produce less smoke and toxic gases when burnt, which reduces the risk of suffocation and poisoning for the occupants and firefighters[^3^].
- FRLS cables have a higher temperature index than PVC cables, which means they can withstand higher temperatures without losing their insulation properties. This ensures the continuity of power supply and communication in critical situations[^1^].
- FRLS cables have a lower smoke density than PVC cables, which means they emit less opaque smoke that can impair visibility and hinder rescue operations. The smoke from FRLS cables is also less corrosive and acidic, which reduces the damage to equipment and structures[^2^].
- FRLS cables have a higher oxygen index than PVC cables, which means they require more oxygen to burn. This reduces the chances of ignition and combustion of the cables in case of fire[^1^].
- FRLS cables are more eco-friendly than PVC cables, as they do not release harmful substances such as halogens, chlorine, bromine, etc. into the environment. These substances can cause ozone depletion, acid rain, soil contamination, etc. FRLS cables are also easier to recycle and dispose of than PVC cables[^3^].

- The type and size of the conductor: The conductor is the core part of the cable that carries the electric current. It can be made of copper or aluminium, depending on the application and cost. The size of the conductor determines the current carrying capacity and voltage drop of the cable.
- The type and thickness of the insulation: The insulation is the layer that covers the conductor and protects it from electric shock, short circuit, moisture, etc. It can be made of various materials such as PVC, XLPE, rubber, etc., depending on the temperature rating, voltage rating, fire resistance, etc. The thickness of the insulation affects the diameter and flexibility of the cable.
- The type and material of the sheath: The sheath is the outer layer that covers the insulation and provides mechanical protection to the cable. It can be made of various materials such as PVC, FRLS PVC, rubber, etc., depending on the abrasion resistance, weather resistance, flame retardance, etc. The material of the sheath also determines the smoke emission and toxicity of the cable in case of fire.
- The type and number of cores: The core is a single conductor with insulation and sheath. A cable can have one or more cores depending on the application and configuration. For example, a single core cable is used for DC power supply or earthing, while a multi-core cable is used for AC power supply or communication.
- The standards and specifications: The cable should comply with the relevant standards and specifications for quality, performance, safety, etc. For example, FRLS cables should meet the requirements of IS 694:2010 for low voltage wires and IS 1554:1988 for low voltage cables.

You can consult with a reputable cable manufacturer or supplier to help you choose the right FRLS cable for your project.
